# Assignment 2 Predictive Analysis

## Submission

The assignment solution should be submitted electronically, and consist of a report (as a PDF file) that you submit via Turnitin (by one member of the group), and the code that you create can stay in your GitHub repository.
Each member of the group is also required to submit on vUWS a text file (.txt) listing contributions to the assignment by all members. Individual marks for the assignment will be calculated based on the contributions, in the case of a disagreement between the members, then the marks will be resolved on a case by case bases by the teaching team.
Short answers are good, and you do not need to write long essays or repeat a lecture. Usually a few sentences will be fine. Do use your own words – it is not OK to just repeat text from elsewhere, and we will check. Please write complete sentences, and please check your spelling.

This assignment is worth 40% of the unit assessment tasks.
Submission is due on Friday 28 October 2022, 23:59.

For this assignment, your task is to analyse the data set using the methods you’ve learnt in this unit, you’re more than welcome to use methods you learnt in other units in this assignment.

## Data Preprocessing

This is worth 6, 10, or 14 marks depending on the difficulty of the data set. This task include, but not limited to:
• Simple statistical evaluation of the data set;
• Identify the target variable(s);
• Identify if this is a regression or a classification task;
• Are there any missing data? What can you do about them?
• Which variables are relevant or irrelevant to the task?
• What type of validation/cross-validation procedure will you use? • Data visualisation.

## Methods to use

For the analysis, you need to analyse the data using at least three different methods. You’ll need to use
• Neural Networks, and
• Support Vector Machine
as two of the methods. Do not use linear and logistic regression other than as a compar- ison method. The other methods taught in this subject which you can use are:
• Ridge Lasso regression, • Lasso regression, and
• Naive Bayes
You can substitute these methods with k Nearest Neighbours, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or other machine learning methods.
For each method, write a brief description of your steps to create the model and your prediction. What did you do? Your description should include, but not limit to, answers to the following questions:
• What is the accuracy of your model?
• Is the model a good model? Why or why not?
• Any particular choices you made or had to make in creating model or prediction? Why did you make them?

## Marking

The marks for this assignment will be distributed as follows: • Data preprocessing and preparation: 6, 10 or 14 marks • Method 1: Neural Networks: 15 marks
• Method 2: Support Vector Machine: 15 marks
• Method 3: your choice: 10 marks
• Comparison between the methods: 5 marks • Report overall quality: 5 marks
Bonus points will be given for exceptional work.

The report quality will be marked on the following items: • Structure and content;
• Grammar and spelling; and
• Overall presentation.

## What to submit

Report: A pdf file (.pdf) of your report should be submitted into Turnitin.

## Code:

All code should be written in Python. Submit your code as part of your report (Jupyter Notebook) or if your code is in a separate e.g. ̇.py file, identify its GitHub location in your report.
